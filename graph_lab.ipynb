    "### Explanations and Justifications \n",
    "\n",
    "#### GraphBuilder\n",
    "Seperating GraphBuilder from all other classes was key to ensuring the design is scalable. Now, the graph class is completely independant from the format of the CSV file and if the CSV file is to change we can simply add another method to GraphBuilder that can read it. In summary GraphBuilder enables Graph to be independant of the CSV files and can be adjusted in an open-closed manner.\n",
    "#### Node\n",
    "The Node class is what represents the subway stations. It containts all information with the exception of some columns about the zone and rail as they weren't used. Representing each station as an object does use more memory, but enables us to encapsulate the information easily and makes the data at each station easily accessable.\n",
    "#### Graph\n",
    "Graph uses nodes to represent the entire subway system in one class. It possess a graph attribute which contains a dictionary (Map) of every station. We used a map instead of an array so that we can accomodate any stationID. Graph also possess the ability to add stations (Nodes) and connections (vertices)\n",
    "#### MetricsCalculator\n",
    "MetricsCalculator seperates the functionality of pulling information from the graph from Graph. Each desired function is a public function that can be called as long as a graph is passed in. Additionally, it enables us to create more functions to compute metrics in an open-closed principle without overloading the GraphClass. \n",
    "#### PathFactory\n",
    "PatchFactory is a class that contains all algorithms used for generating itineraries. As of now it contains a method for computing path using Djikstras and the A* algorithm. If any algorithms were to be added to the library, they can be appended to PathFactory without modifying any other algorithms. \n",
    "#### Itinerary\n",
    "The itinerary class holds all relevant information about a path from one place to another. It is generated by the different methods of PathFactory. It can display the path from one station to another and removes redudant information like every stop on the line a user would take. "

    "The number of connections refers to how many stops the rail line passes from point A to point B. As we increase the number of stops without switching lines, there seems to be no drastic change in the execution time of either algorithm. We can extrapolate these results to infer that regardless of path distance, the algorithms perform a similar, if not the same amount of operations. The data makes sense with Djikstras as it solves the single source shortest path problem and for A* since it is a heuristic approach to Djikstra's. In a practical application, it would be possible to precompute all single source shortest paths from each node for a total running time of O(N^2). If our priority queue was implemented using a minheap, this could be reduced to O(N\\*Log(N)). To conclude, for a sparse graph, it would be feasible to precompute all single source shortest paths for long-term use in some applications. In the case of something like a subway system, it would be safe to assume the graph doesn't change except with the occasional maintenance of certain lines."

    "From the above graphs, line changes per test case indicates the number lines changes on the shortest path(i.e. going from line 2 to line 4), in order to get from the starting station to the final destination. It is interesting to note that this second graph definitely contradicts the first one, highlighting that there are applications for which the A* algorithm would be beneficial to use over Dijkstra's. If it is known that the incoming dataset/station map includes many lines with the majority of those stations being exclusively accessible on a small amount of those lines, then it seems that the A* search algorithm would provide a more efficient solution to the shortest path problem. We suspect the reason behind this result is due to the fact that A* computes the shortest path using the heuristic approach (physical distance between stations) prior to comparing connections, and as such, determines the shortest path with line changes faster than Dijkstra's - which always compares connections and looks for minimal line changes first."

    "Overall, I feel grateful to have gone through the process of creating this work, as this is the first time I've had the task of providing a programming solution to an open-ended problem, but I will say that there are aspects of the final product that are undesirable and could have been improved. Before I get into that though, I would like to say that graphing the benchmarking results for the first week (a* vs. dijkstra) was something that I enjoyed doing, and am proud of the result since it depicted the differences between the two algorithms with different inputs. In terms of dislikes for the project, I would say the main one would have to be the efficiency with some of the implementations - specifically for subway patrol. Although I understand that this is an np-hard problem, the solution that we came up with seems quite trivial. As discussed previously in the report, we felt like the work that we had to put in to improve it would outweigh the overall gains in performance. However, if we did have more time, I believe it would have been interesting to have been able to try and engineer a more efficient solution.\n",

I think the time that was taken to ensure that all of the modules were separate in their folders and files (single responsibility) and further ensure that each module only accessed the features that were required from the others (dependency inversion). It was a time-consuming process to ensure that these principles were followed, and I believe that it should be showcased and apparent when looking at the code from an outward perspective.\n",

    " If I had the chance to do this project over again, I would spend more time in the beginning (during week one) focusing on laying the groundwork for the coding environment, ensuring that it could be easily extendable. I think this is something that we had difficulty with during the end of week 1, and resulted in more work, and having to refactor the code to meet the SOLID criteria. In addition, I think there was a lot of focus on the actual code itself, and it was mentioned in one of the lectures that although the code is important, the experience of engineering a solution was the goal of this lab and this course in general. So, I would try and focus less on the code and more on the steps that we took along the way to come to that solution. "

While it may not have been implemented very efficiently (possibly slower than standard brute force methods), I feel that the code is surprisingly compact and readable.

It made the solution so easy to implement, and I would like people to notice that.\n",

    "One thing I would change if we redid this project would be breaking down our code more. Initially, a lot of our code was in very few files. As the project got larger it became harder to figure out which file contained which piece of code. By the end of week 2, we separated our files and folders, as well as made our naming scheme more consistent, but if we did this from the start, we would have not only worked faster but not had to do it later. Aside from that though, I feel we did a great job throughout the lab. Our solutions are functional, and our code is well documented throughout the report and python files. "
